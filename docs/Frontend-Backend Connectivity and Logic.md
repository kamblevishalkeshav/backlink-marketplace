## 2. Authentication and Authorization Flow

### 2.1 Authentication System

#### 2.1.1 User Authentication Flow
1. **Login Process**
   - User submits credentials to `/api/auth/login` endpoint
   - Backend validates credentials against User Service
   - On success, JWT token is generated with appropriate claims
   - Token is returned to client with refresh token
   - Client stores tokens securely (HTTP-only cookies or local storage)

2. **Token Validation**
   - Each API request includes JWT in Authorization header
   - API Gateway validates token signature and expiration
   - Claims are extracted and added to request context
   - Request proceeds to appropriate service if valid
   - 401 Unauthorized response if token is invalid

3. **Token Refresh**
   - Client detects expired token via 401 response or proactive check
   - Refresh token is sent to `/api/auth/refresh` endpoint
   - Backend validates refresh token and issues new JWT
   - Client updates stored tokens
   - Session is maintained without requiring re-login

4. **Logout Process**
   - Client sends request to `/api/auth/logout` endpoint
   - Backend invalidates refresh token in database
   - Client clears stored tokens
   - User is redirected to login page

#### 2.1.2 Multi-factor Authentication
1. **MFA Enrollment**
   - User initiates MFA setup in account settings
   - Backend generates secret and QR code
   - User scans code with authenticator app
   - User verifies setup with first code
   - MFA flag is enabled in user profile

2. **MFA Verification**
   - After password validation, MFA challenge is issued
   - User submits verification code
   - Backend validates code against stored secret
   - On success, authentication flow continues
   - Failed attempts are logged and limited

### 2.2 Authorization Framework

1. **Role Assignment**
   - Admin assigns roles to users through User Management
   - Roles are stored in user profile
   - Role changes are logged in audit trail
   - Role information is included in JWT claims

2. **Permission Checking**
   - Each API endpoint defines required permissions
   - API Gateway checks user roles against required permissions
   - Middleware enforces access control at service level
   - Frontend components conditionally render based on permissions
   - Unauthorized actions return 403 Forbidden response

#### 2.2.2 Resource-Level Permissions
1. **Resource Ownership**
   - Resources store owner or creator information
   - Ownership checks are performed for sensitive operations
   - Delegation and sharing capabilities are supported
   - Hierarchical access is enforced (e.g., project access grants access to contained items)

2. **Permission Inheritance**
